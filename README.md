Project Description

[a] Brief Description

Our project aims to apply the Object-Oriented Programming concepts taught in our  Java class. With this in mind, our team has developed a multiplayer networked top-down battle royale named “2DRoyale”.

[b] Motivations & Objective

In the game, players battle each other in a shrinking arena facilitated by an encroaching gas wall that deals with massive contact damage. Each player is initially spawned at random locations throughout the map. Players will need to scavenge for weapons located in crates randomly spawned around the map, which contains one of four possible weapons. Players can then seek out and eliminate one another until only one player is left standing.
For a more personalized user experience, players can enter their usernames, which are displayed above their characters and in the kill-feed.
